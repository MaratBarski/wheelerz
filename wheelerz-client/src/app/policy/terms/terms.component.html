Feedback and Reviews. In some cases, users may be able to add a review ("Review"), rating ("Rating") of a service, or provide other forms of feedback, such as comments (together hereinafter the "Feedback"). Some of the Feedback will be visible to other users of the Platform. The Feedback does not reflect the opinion of the venture and is not verified by us and may be inaccurate, incorrect or misleading. You agree that if you post a Review and/or Rating it will be factual and truthful and will not contain any offensive or defamatory language. Users are prohibited from manipulating the Reviews and Ratings in any manner, for example, by instructing a third party to write a positive/negative Review in regards to another user. You hereby assign to “Wheelerz” all rights in the Feedback and agree that we shall have the right to use and fully use such Feedback in any manner it deems appropriate, including for commercial uses. The venture reserves the right to verify the reviews and to delete them, in its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, Feedback that is inaccurate, misleading, or defamatory.

<br><br>
Service Fees. (Dear Client: would you like to have a different TOU for the hotels listed on the platform, as well as other service providers?) <br>
Some of the services provided on the Platform may be subject to a service fee (the "Service Fee"). The Service Fee will be charged using the payment details that you provided when requesting the service, or based on the preferred payment method that you selected in your user Account. We may limit or change the available payment methods in our sole discretion. <br>
The payment processing system that we use is provided by a third party (for example, PayPal). Such third parties use accepted industry security standards. Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that this service will be free of errors and do not take any responsibility, other than specifically stated in these Terms, for any faults, errors and or any other damages caused by these third-party payment platforms.  <br>
In certain cases, your selected method of payment may incur you additional fees. For example, some credit card companies charge a fee for online payments. These third-party fees are charged directly, and taken by, the relevant third party and not by us. Any questions relating to these additional third-party fees should be raised directly with the relevant third party.<br>
Any applicable Service Fees (including any applicable Taxes) will be displayed prior to confirming your request for the service. The Service Fee may vary based on your geographical location. We reserve the right to change the Service Fees at any time, and will provide users adequate notice of any such changes before they become effective.<br>
You are responsible for paying any Service Fees that you owe to us. Except as otherwise stated in these Terms, or unless decided otherwise, in writing, by the venture, the Service Fees are non-refundable. [Dear client: it is best to leave this last part as your official policy. We have worded the sentence in a way that you have flexibility, and if you decide on a money back guarantee, this is still possible.] <br>
Indemnification. You agree to indemnify and hold “Wheelerz” (and its officers, employees, and agents) harmless, including costs and attorneys’ fees, from any claim or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of (a) your use of the Site, (b) your violation of these Terms, (c) your violation of applicable laws or regulations or (d) your User Content.  “Wheelerz”  reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims.  You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of the venture.  We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.<br>

Third-Party Links & Ads.  The Site may contain links to third-party websites and/or services, and/or display advertisements for third parties (collectively, “Third-Party Links & Ads”).

Our venture provides access to these Third-Party Links & Ads only as a convenience to you, and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third-Party Links & Ads.

<br>
General<br>
Changes.  These Terms are subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us (if any), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our Site.  Any changes to these Terms will be effective ten (10) calendar days following our notice to you (directly or via the Platform). These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Site.

For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from the venture in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that the venture provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were be in a hardcopy writing. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.<br>
Entire Terms. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Site. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation”.
